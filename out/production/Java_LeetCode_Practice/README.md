# 🧠 TopInterview_LeetCode – Java Practice Repository

Welcome to **TopInterview_LeetCode** — a personal collection of **LeetCode problems and solutions** written in **Java** 💻. This repository is designed for **practicing algorithms & data structures**, **strengthening problem-solving skills**, and **preparing for technical interviews**.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

This repository aims to create a **clean, organized, and efficient archive** of coding challenges, helping you to:

- Strengthen problem-solving skills
- Master **Data Structures & Algorithms**
- Practice **patterns used in real technical interviews**
- Build **clean, readable, and efficient code**
- Track long-term progress

This project is actively expanding as new problems are solved and documented.
